# movieapp-laravel

This is a movie web application that lets you see details of movies, that lets you search for the latest movies and view their trailers as well. 

Using the api of https://www.themoviedb.org/ , I created this application using Laravel 8, bootstrap 5 and livewire. 

It is a simple application showcasing cinema details and so forth.
